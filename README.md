OSX platform layer to follow [Handmade Hero](https://handmadehero.org/).

# Acknowledgements

This is heavily inspired by [Ted Bendixon's Handmade Hero Mac Platform Layer](https://github.com/TheoBendixson/Handmade-Hero-Mac-Platform-Layer-Following-Videos).
In fact it is being built by following his [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5l6CvHwWsc&t=5s) with some tweaks here and there.
